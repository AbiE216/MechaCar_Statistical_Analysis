## Purpose

## Summary 
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Linear Regression MPG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106715300/193467448-3510e357-306d-4014-aae0-e9e590ab4ae6.png)
This image shows the P-values of each variable in comparison with the MPG; it also shows the the coefficient of determination or R-squared value. The R-squared value sits at .72, this would indicate a strong correlation between MPG anf the variables given. The P-Values dig more into each individual variable in relation to MPG. Assuming a 95% confidence level, the variables that are significant: are Vehicle Length, and Ground clearance. Variables that are not significant: Vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and All wheel drive (AWD). 
The other considerations within this data, the slope is not zero, it is a significant variable in terms of P-values, and it follows a strong correlation coefficient. Because the correlation coefficient is strong, it would suggest that the current variable do a good job of predicting MechaCar prototypes.
